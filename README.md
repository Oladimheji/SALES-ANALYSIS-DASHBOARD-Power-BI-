# SALES-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD-Power-BI-
_This project focuses on analyzing Superstore sales performance using Power BI for interactive visualization and dashboard creation. Initial data cleaning and structuring were performed in Microsoft Excel, while deeper visual analytics and insights were developed in Power BI. The dashboard is divided into four main sections: Overview, Sales Analysis, Customer Insights, and Shipping, providing a full view of operational and strategic business performance._

**The report answers the following business questions:**
1. Which product categories and sub-categories drive the most revenue?
2. Who are our most valuable customers, and what is their lifetime value?
3. How does customer behavior vary across segments and regions?
4. What are the most preferred shipping methods and their impact on order volume and delivery time?
5. How do sales and customer trends vary month-over-month and state-by-state?
6. How do this year's metrics compare to last yearâ€™s performance?

**I took the following steps to create the report:**
***1. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Excel)***
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected inconsistent entries.
- Reformatted date fields and standardized categorical labels.
- Created calculated columns for metrics like profit margins and shipping delays.

***2. Data Modeling and Visualization (Power BI)***
- Imported cleaned datasets into Power BI for relationship modeling across sales, customers, shipping, and regions.
- Created custom measures (e.g., Total Sales, CLV, AOV) using DAX.
- Designed a user-friendly interface with slicers for calendar year, region, category, segment, etc.
- Developed visual storytelling through bar charts, pie/donut charts, line graphs, and maps.
